# wepets
This is a Django+Webpack+ReactJS multi-pages web application.
My goal is building a e-business platform for the food, medicine and accessory of pets.
The project is still WIP.
### Design Pattern:
* ReactJS render the templates.
* Using pure json API of Django to feed front end. So that could make front end dev more independent and clean.
* Django as back end framework, handle most business logic
* Use Postgres as database.
* Use ELB to handle high quantity requests as well as corountine in python.
### Prerequisites
Need install Python, Django and NodeJS on your local for development.
